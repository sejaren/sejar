welcome to our special space! üíñ This digital haven holds the essence of our shared moments and emotions‚Äîwhere every word echoes my deep affection for you.

		I'm actually new to this web page,HTML and other stuffs, so I can only do this much for now. I've been working on this for almost a week, and for a couple of days I've worked until 2 am. The reason I'm mentioning this is that I've put in a lot of effort only for you üòÖ. But that's not the point; I wanted to share something. This is a very new feeling for me, not like my usual self. You know a lot about our family, maybe even about me üòÖ. I'm not usually like this it's the first time I'm doing something like this (standing in Bustand) in my life. I'm not sure how you'll perceive this. I don't have any bad habits like drinking alcohol and I've never touched them to this day. I've never been in a relationship or even touched a girl before. But leaving that aside, what do you think about me? I don't want to disturb you, especially now. I know your exams are approaching in a few months, so this might not be the best time to approach you. But I do have something urgent, which I'll explain later. For now, I just need your perception, that's all I'm seeking. I'm willing to wait for however long it takes, so don't worry about rushing your response. Your studies should be our focus. If you feel like I'm disturbing you or you're not comfortable with my presence in your life, please feel free to tell me directly or tell your friends. I completely understand your situation. I kindly request that you don't inform your family members about this, at least for now, please üôè. I hope you understand. It might cause unnecessary worry for my mom if I engage in this kind of activity at the moment. However, I'll make sure that it won't be an issue later on.
