  Day -1 >> Thesday, 31 October 2023 <p>
  
  
  <p>The beautiful evening, the sun setting slowly, im  waiting for you. In the meantime, I met some friends, and they are talking a lot. I feel a mix of panic and excitement Can’t able to describe .I waited for some time as I wanted to leave, but they were not leaving. Suddenly, something happened to me; i think  my sixth sense was at work😂 I ask Shyam and drove to stand somewhere to see you but in between 😶‍🌫 you are came😍 you are very beautiful🙈. Kavithaila theriyathu 😅.
I followed you but enakku oru mathiri irunthuchu so I suddenly told him to stop near planet soda and step out from the bike and then I 😅 wanted to see you so I again come where you stand. Nee Nagapattinam bus kitta pona na vanthu patha kanom it was the first time in my life to search a girl ❤. Romba neram kangal thediyathu unnai like a hunter search for an animal . But I can’t find you. Nanum thaingayir bus nikkura eduthukku vantha thidirnu Shyam antha bus la poranga apdi nu sonna Avunga friend kunichu pathichi apdi nu sonna.i don’t know what to do it was my first experience. I've never done anything like this before, but I wanted to do this…….
Nee poitta ana Pathiyanu therila
Unnapathi nenachitte iruntha
Wow what a feeling it was</p>
